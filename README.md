Funny John Conway 's Game of life simulation in Java

This is my first Java Application. A desktop version of Game of Life made with NetBeans.

It is kind of cool see it working. The code is kind of coupled mostly in JocVidaX3.java, but it's quite weel documented and the methods are very clear about their use.

Sorry, the UI is in Spanish.
